# In this repository, I will try to learn how to do a TDD process in the python.

1. In this github repository, I will try to TDD the FizzBuzz game in python.

the  rules of FizzBuzz game is that you enter a number. If it can be divided by 15, it will return FizzBuzz, if it can be divided by 3, it will return Fizz, if it can be divided by 5, it returns Buzz. If not, it will return the number itself.

The coding of FizzBuzz test has been done in two ways.

In one of them, only a method called FizzBuzz has been defined.

In the second one, a class called FizzBuzz has been defined and a method called play has been defined.


In order to run the test file, you should run the following command in the command line:

``` python test_sample.py ```
